# Recommendation to Management from the Analysis
* Evaluate the Online Booking procedure and UI/UX experience. Make the interface simple and user-friendly.
* Wi-Fi service should be improved. Ensure a quick, secure, and consistent connection.
* Provide passengers with basic and easy-to-understand map directions to the gate location.
* More assistance required for first time passengers. They may not be well-versed in airline protocol.
* Conduct a survey for Economy Plus, Economy Class, and Personal Travel to better understand why their satisfaction is so low.
